1. Efficient Data Structures for Image Representation:

Microscope Images:
For microscope images, where each pixel is either black (part of the parasite) or white (background), 
a sparse representation like a compressed sparse row (CSR) matrix would be efficient. In this representation, 
only the non-zero elements (black pixels) are stored along with their row and column indices. This is suitable 
because most of the image consists of white pixels and storing them explicitly would be wasteful.

Dye Sensor Images:
For dye sensor images, which only show where the dye is present, a bitmap representation would be efficient. 
Since these images mainly consist of areas with dye, a simple bitmap indicating the presence or absence of 
dye at each pixel would suffice. Each pixel would be represented by a single bit (0 for absence of dye, 1 
for presence of dye).
